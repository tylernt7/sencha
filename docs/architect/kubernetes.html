    <h1>Kubernetes</h1>	
    <h2>Difference between Docker and Kubernetes</h2>
    <p>As the number of containerized applications grew to span hundreds of Docker containers deployed across multiple servers, operating them became more complex. This is where Kubernetes can help. Kubernetes automatically <i>orchestrates the container</i> lifecycle, distributing the application containers across the hosting infrastructure. Kubernetes scales resources up or down, depending on demand. It provisions, schedules, deletes, and monitors the health of the containers.</p>

	<h2>Replication and Clustering</h2>
	<p><i>Replication</i> is the process of copying data from one database server to another (if a database goes down, it is replaced by another), while <i>clustering</i> is the process of grouping multiple database servers together to work as a single entity. Clustering is used for high availability and load balancing while replication is used for backup and disaster recovery purposes.</p>			
	<p>Database <i>synchronization</i> is the process of maintaining consistency between two or more databases using different types of replication, such as snapshot, transactional, and merge replication.</p>
