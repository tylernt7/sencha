    <h1>Kubernetes</h1>
	
	<h2>Difference between Docker and Kubernetes</h2>
	As the number of containerized applications grew to span hundreds of Docker containers deployed across multiple servers, operating them became more complex. This is where Kubernetes can help. Kubernetes automatically <i>orchestrates the container</i> lifecycle, distributing the application containers across the hosting infrastructure. Kubernetes scales resources up or down, depending on demand. It provisions, schedules, deletes, and monitors the health of the containers.
