    <h1>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</h1>
		
	<h2>Concept</h2>
	<p>A Public Key Infrastructure is a system that can manage (create, distribute, store and revoke) digital certificates. The purpose of a PKI is to secure the electronic communication (e-commerce, internet banking and confidential email). Certificates are used for authentication as well as validating the information.<br>
	Each individual has a public key and a private key in an asymmetric system. The public key can verify a digital signature that the private key creates.</p>

	<li><b>Authentication</b>: It confirms the identity of a user. It is performed by password verification.<br>
      <ul>
	    <li><b>Basic (Access) Authentication</b>: It requires users to provide a user name and password credentials.</li>
	    <li><b>Single Sign-On (SSO)</b>: It lets users authenticate themselves just once to access information on any of several systems.</li>			
      </ul>		
	</li>
	<li><b>Authorization</b>: It determines the access level granted a user. It happens after authentication. It is performed by assigning a user to pre-defined groups (classes). Each group lists available objects, along with an associated object-access type (read-only, write-only, or read-write privilege/permission).<br>
	</li>

	<h2>Keycloak</h2>
	<p>Keycloak is an open source identity and access management (IAM) solution. It provides authentication, authorization, user federation (LDAP and Active Directory) and user management for applications and services.</p>
	<b>Standard Protocols</b>
    <ul>
	  <li><b>OAuth 2.0</b>: OAuth2 clients (front end applications) can obtain access tokens from the authorization server using the token endpoint and use these same tokens to access resources protected by a resource server (back end services).</li>
	  <li><b>OpenID Connect 1.0</b>: OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of <b>OAuth 2.0</b> to verify the identity of a user by an ID token (using SSO).</li>	  	
	  <li><b>SAML 2.0</b>: SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) uses XML-based messages to exchange data between an identity provider and a service provider (using SSO).</li>	  
    </ul>
	
	<h2>Definitions</h2>
	<b>Digital Signature</b>: It is an electronic fingerprint that proves the authenticity and integrity of a digital document. The signature verifier can make sure that the signed content was signed by the alleged sender and was received in an unchanged form.<br>
	<b>Digital Certificate</b>: It is an electronic document that proves the ownership of a public key and verifies the identity and authenticity of an individual user or device by checking the signature of the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate.<br>
	<b>DER</b>: Distinguished Encoding Rules, a binary certificate format for encoding data structures defined by ASN.1. DER is used for encoding X.509 certificates, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), certificate trust lists (CTLs), online certificate status protocol (OCSP), public and private keys.<br>
	<b>PEM</b>: Privacy Enhanced Mail, a file that stores one or more items in <i>Base64</i> encoding, such as a certificate, a certificate chain, a public or private key.<br>
	<b>IEEE P1363</b>: It is a standard for public-key cryptography. The P1363 signature format is r || s (a concatenation of two values, r and s), where r and s are zero-padded and have the same size in bytes as the order of the curve. For example, for NIST P-256 curve, r and s are zero-padded to 32 bytes.<br>
	<b>CRL</b>: Certificate Revocation List, a list of certificates that have been revoked by the issuing Certificate Authority (CA). The volume of CRL depends on the number and size of the revoked certificates, as well as the frequency and format of the CRL updates. A daily or weekly updated base CRL can contain hundreds or thousands of revoked certificates, each with a serial number and a revocation reason and revocation date. A CRL also has a signature from the CA and a validity period. When a client application (web browser or email client) uses a certificate for authentication or encryption, it does not only check the certificate signature and validity but also downloads the most recently issued CRL from the CA's website to check that the certificate has not been revoked. A new CRL is issued on a regular periodic basis (hourly, daily, or weekly). The nextUpdate field of the CRL is the expiration date of the CRL. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt">RFC5280</a><br>
	<b>OCSP</b>: Online Certificate Status Protocol, an alternate certificate revocation technology instead of CRL. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6960.txt">RFC6960</a><br>	
	<b>PKCS#7</b>: Public-Key Cryptography Standards #7, defines a standard syntax for storing signed and/or encrypted data, such as certificates, CRLs, or messages. PKCS#7 can use either DER (binary) or PEM (Base64 ASCII) encoding. The latest version, 1.5, is described in RFC 2315.<br>	
	<b>PKCS#10</b>: Public-Key Cryptography Standards #10, defines the format and syntax of a certificate signing request (CSR), which is a message sent by an entity to a certificate authority (CA) to apply for a digital identity certificate. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2986.txt">RFC2986</a><br>	
	<b>PKCS#11</b>: Public-Key Cryptography Standards #11, defines a platform-independent API to access cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules (HSM) and smart cards. It allows applications to perform cryptographic operations, such as generating, encrypting, decrypting, signing, verifying and storing keys and data. Some software that use PKCS #11 are Mozilla Firefox, OpenSSL, and Oracle Solaris.<br>
	<b>PKCS#12</b>: Public-Key Cryptography Standards #12, defines a file format for storing multiple cryptographic objects, such as certificates, certificate chains, public and private keys, in a single file. PKCS#12 files are encrypted and signed. PKCS#12 is the successor to Microsoft's "PFX".<br>	
	<b>ASN.1</b>: Abstract Syntax Notation One, a standard interface description language for defining data structures and data serialization formats in a platform-independent way (formal notation to describe data types). The ASN.1 encoding rules include BER (Basic Encoding Rules), DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), PER (Packed Encoding Rules) and XER (XML Encoding Rules). The Bouncy Castle APIs support ASN.1 data structures and encodings, as well as various protocols and standards that use ASN.1, such as X.509, CMS, OCSP, etc.<br>	
	<b>OID</b>: Object IDentifier, a sequence of numbers (such as 2.5.4.3) identifying objects in a unique way in X.509 certificates (a basic ASN.1 type). OIDs are used to identify various elements in certificates, such as algorithms, extensions, policies, etc.<br>
	<b>AIA</b>: Authority Information Access, an extension in X.509 certificates that indicates how to access CA information and services about the issuer of the certificate as detailed in RFC 3280.<br>
    <b>HSM</b>: Hardware Security Module, a device for the secure execution of cryptographic operations (encryption, decryption, authorization, authentication and digital signing). It generates and stores keys inside a hardened, tamper-resistant device. It prevents physical/unauthorised tampering with self-destruct mechanisms.<br>
	
	<h2>Certificate Revocation</h2>
	<p>To revoke a root certificate, the root CA can issue a CRL that contains its own serial number, and sign it with its own private key. The vendor (operating system, browser) or the user can also revoke the root certificate from the trusted root store.	
	<p>To revoke an intermediate certificate, you need to be the root CA that issued it, or have access to the root CA's private key. By revoking an intermediate certificate, you also invalidate all the end-entity certificates that were issued by that intermediate CA, since they are part of the same certificate chain.</p>
	<p>To revoke an end-entity certificate, you need to be the intermediate CA that issued it, or have access to the intermediate CA's private key. By revoking an end-entity certificate, you only affect that specific certificate and not the others that were issued by the same intermediate CA.</p>
	Revocation Reasons:
	<ul>
	<li><b>0 - Unspecified</b>: The CA did not specify a reason for revoking the certificate</li>
	<li><b>1 - Key Compromise</b>: The private key associated with the certificate has been compromised</li>
    <li><b>2 - CA Compromise</b>: The private key of the CA that issued the certificate has been compromised</li>
	<li><b>3 - Affiliation Changed</b>: The certificate holder has changed their name or other information in the certificate</li>
	<li><b>4 - Superseded</b>: The certificate has been replaced by a newer one</li>
	<li><b>5 - Cessation Of Operation</b>: The certificate is no longer needed</li>
	<li><b>6 - Certificate Hold</b>: The certificate has been temporarily suspended</li>
	<li><b>8 - Remove From CRL</b>: The certificate has been removed from the CRL and is no longer revoked</li>
	<li><b>9 - Privilege Withdrawn</b>: The certificate holder has lost some privileges or rights that were granted by the certificate</li>
	<li><b>10 - AA Compromise</b>: The private key of an Attribute Authority (AA) that vouched for some attributes in the certificate has been compromised</li>
	<li><b>11 - Weak Algorithm Or Key</b>: The certificate key uses a weak cryptographic algorithm, or the key is too short, or the key was generated in an unsafe manner</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Chain of Trust (Certificate Chain)</h2>		
	<p>It is an ordered list of certificates that enable the receiver to verify the trustworthiness of a sender (e.g. SSL/TLS certificate). If the certificate is not issued directly by Root CA, a chain is formed. An intermediate certificate is considered reliable if the Root CA is responsible for it, i.e. the certificate of the intermediate CA was issued by the Root CA and has not been revoked in the meantime. Each certificate in the chain is signed by the entity that issued the next certificate in the chain. The chain terminates with a Root CA certificate, which is a self-signed certificate that is trusted by the receiver's browser or device.</p>

	End-Entity Certificate: Végfelhasználói Tanúsítvány<br>
	Intermediate/Subordinate Certificate: Közbenső/Köztes/Alárendelt Tanúsítvány<br>
	Root Certificate: Gyökér/Fő Tanúsítvány<br>
	Certificate Revocation: Tanúsítvány visszavonás<br>
	
	<h2>Web browsers</h2>
	<p>When you visit a website that has an SSL certificate, your browser will check if the certificate is valid, matches the domain name, and is issued by a trusted authority. To do this, your browser will follow the certificate chain from the end-entity certificate to the intermediate certificates and finally to the root certificate. Your browser will also check if the certificates are not expired, revoked, or tampered with. If any of these checks fail, your browser will display an error message, such as NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID, and warn you that the connection is not secure.</p>
