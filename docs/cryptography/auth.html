    <h1>Authentication and Authorization</h1>
		
	<b>Authentication</b>: It verifies (confirms) the <i>identity</i> of a user.<br>
	<b>Authorization</b>: It determines the user's <i>access rights</i>. It occurs after authentication. Users are assigned to pre-defined groups. Each group specifies the available resources and permissions (read-only, write-only, or read-write privileges).<br>
	<center><img src="images\auth.png" width="50%" height="50%"/></center>
	<b>Single Sign-On (SSO)</b>: It allows users to log in once to access information on multiple applications<br>
	<ul>
	<li>When a user logs into their Google account, they can access YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive, and other Google services without needing to log in again.</li>
	<li>When an employee logs into the company's intranet, they can access email, HR systems, project management tools, and other internal applications without needing to log in again.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Keycloak</h2>
	<p>Keycloak is an open source identity and access management (IAM) solution. It provides authentication, authorization, user federation (LDAP and Active Directory) and user management for applications and services.</p>
	<b>Standard Protocols</b>
    <ul>
	  <li><b>OAuth</b>: OAuth2 clients (front end applications) can obtain access tokens from the authorization server using the token endpoint and use these same tokens to access resources protected by a resource server (back end services).</li>
	  <li><b>OpenID Connect</b>: OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of <b>OAuth 2.0</b> to verify the identity of a user by an ID token.</li>	  	
	  <li><b>SAML</b>: SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) uses XML-based messages to exchange data between an identity provider and a service provider.</li>	  
    </ul>

	<h2>JSON Web Token (JWT)</h2>
	<p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting claims between parties as a JSON object. JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are: Header, Payload and Signature. The header consists the type of the token and the signing algorithm. The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about the user and additional data. Some of claims are: iss (issuer), sub (subject), aud (audience), exp (expiration time) and iat (issued at). The three parts of the JWT are Base64Url encoded.</p>
	<p>The information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA. JWTs are commonly signed using one of two algorithms: HS256 (HMAC using SHA256) and RS256 (RSA using SHA256).</p>
	
	<h2>Refresh Token</h2>
	<p>A refresh token is a type of token that is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. Refresh tokens are issued by an authorization server, and are used by client applications to access protected resources on a server on behalf of a user. Refresh tokens have a longer lifetime than access tokens, but they can also be revoked or invalidated by the server for various reasons.<br>Here is a typical flow involving refresh tokens:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The user logs in and the authorization server returns both an access token and a refresh token.</li>
	  <li>The client (a web or mobile application) uses the access token to access protected resources.</li>	  
	  <li>When an access token expires, <i>without asking the user to log in again</i>, the client uses the refresh token to request a new access token from the server (<i>transparently</i>).</li>
	  <li>If the refresh token is valid, the server issues a new access token.</li>
	</ul>
