    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
	<b>1. How much can I afford to lose?</b><br>Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.<br>
	<b>2. Minimum 1:2 risk/reward ratio.</b><br>
		<i>Forex (Major Pairs)</i> 1:2 minimum, ideally 1:2.5<br>
		<i>Cryptocurrencies (Crypto)</i> 1:3 or higher<br>
		<i>Equities (Stocks)</i> 1:3 or higher<br>
		<i>Commodities (e.g., Gold, Oil)</i> 1:3 or higher<br>				
	<b>3. Maximum 2% of capital may be invested into a position (position size).</b><br>For instance, if you have a $1,000 account and you limit your risk to 2%, you are only risking $20 on any particular trade.<br>

	1 pip = 10 points = $10 (for standard lot size: 1.00)<br>

    <h2>Risk/Reward</h2> 
	On a $1,000 account, even with only 4 wins out of 10 trades (a 40% success rate), winning $40 on successful trades (TP) and losing $20 on unsuccessful ones (SL) still results in a $40 profit (4%), since 4 * $40 = $160 > 6 * $20 = $120.<br>

	<h2>Leading</h2>
	Indicators that predict/signal future economic activity and market trends.
	
	<h2>Futures</h2>
	A derivative contract to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date.	
	
	<h2>Margin</h2>
	Borrowing money from a broker to trade assets, secured by a deposit known as margin.<br>
	<br>
	Example: Suppose you have $1,000 in your account, and the current price of Bitcoin is 50,000 USD/BTC. Let's say you purchase 0.02 BTC.<br>
	<br>
	Position Size: The position size represents the total value of the trade. In this case, it is calculated as:<br>
	<b>Position Size = 0.02 BTC * 50,000 USD/BTC = $1,000.</b><br>
	<br>
	Margin (deposit): When using leverage, you do not need to commit the full $1,000 of your own capital. Suppose you choose a 10:1 leverage. Margin is the small amount that is locked from your account to secure your leveraged position. In this case, the margin is calculated as:<br>
	<b>Margin = Position Size / Leverage = $1,000 / 10 = $100.</b><br>
	<br>
	This indicates that to open the trade, your broker will reserve $100 from your account as deposit. With this margin, you are able to control a $1,000 position even though you are only using $100 of your own funds. Consequently, the maximum potential loss will be limited to that $100 margin (not your full $1,000 balance).<br>
	<br>
	In general, to avoid a margin call (liquidation of your position), it is advisable to maintain an account balance where the maximum risk (defined by the stop loss) amounts to only a small percentage of your account (for example, 1–2%). Trading with a small account balance (e.g., $1) using leverage is extremely risky, because even a slight price movement can immediately empty the margin.<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Capital</b>: $1,000<br>
	<b>Risk (%)</b>: 2%<br>
	<b>Entry Price</b>: $50,000 (Price of 1 BTC)<br>
	<b>Quantity purchased</b>: $1,000 / $50,000 = 0.02 BTC<br>
	<b>Risk Amount</b>: 2% * $1,000 = $20<br>
	<b>Stop Loss</b>: Entry Price − (Risk Amount / BTC quantity) = $50,000 − ($20 / 0.02) = $49,000<br>
	If the price of BTC drops to $49,000, then the value of 0.02 BTC will be $980, which results in a $20 loss deducted from the original capital.<br>
	Note: The stop loss is based on the market price, not the total capital.<br>

	<h2>Leverage (tőkeáttétel)</h2>
	Leverage is the ratio of borrowed money to your own capital. For example, if you use 1:10 leverage, you use 10 units of borrowed money for every 1 unit of your own capital.
	
	<h2>Arbitrage</h2>
	An asset is bought in one market (or exchange) and sold in another for a higher price.
	
	<h2>PIP / LOT</h2>
	In the forex market, trading is measured in LOTs rather than by units used for stocks or cryptocurrencies. If you use 1:5 leverage in the crypto market, you might consider using around 1:20 in the forex market.
