    <h1>Technical Analysis</h1> 
    <h2>Moving Average (MA)</h2>  
	<p>A moving average is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set.</p> 
	<p>It smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price.</p>
	<p>Moving averages with a shorter look back period (20 days, for example) will also respond quicker to price changes than an average with a longer look back period (200 days).</p> 	
	- Short-term: 5, 10, 20 min/hour/day/week<br>
	- Medium-term: 50 min/hour/day/week<br>
	- Long-term: 100 Ã©s 200 min/hour/day/week	
	
	<p><b>Types of moving averages</b></p>
	<p>- <b>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</b>: unweighted average of the previous k data-points.</p>
	<p>- <b>Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</b>: more weighting on the most recent price data.</p>
	<p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
	<p>- It is calculated based on historical data, and not predictive.</p>
	<p>- It works well in strong trending conditions but poorly in ranging conditions.</p>
	<p>- It is best to utilize another indicator to help clarify the trend.</p>

	<h2>Fibonacci retracement (Price pullback levels)</h2>
	Horizontal lines on a stock chart that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. Fibonacci retracement levels are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
	
	<h2>Elliott wave theory</h2>
	The principle relies on analyzing price charts to identify wave patterns, which are <b>fractal</b> (self-similar patterns appearing at every degree of trend) in nature, meaning they repeat across different timeframes, and discern what prices may do next. It is about human psychology: market prices move in predictable, repeating waves.<br>
