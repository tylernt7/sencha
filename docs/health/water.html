    <h1>Pure Water: Deuterium-depleted water (DDW)</h1> 
    <p><b>0. Purify the water</b></p>
    <ul><li>Leave the still mineral water or tap water for 3-4 hours (gases escape)</li>
    <li>Boil the water</li>	
    <li>Cool the water</li>	
    <li>Filter the limescale using clean gauze</li>
    <li>Keep the bottle in the freezer until 3/4 of it is frozen</li>
    <li>Keep the frozen water (3/4), throw away unfrozen water (1/4)</li>
    <li>Melt the ice at room temperature</li></ul>
    <p><b>1. Remove the first layer of ice</b></p>
    <ul><li>Take the purified water</li>
    <li>Fill a PET/plastic bottle (no glass and metal) with water up to about 85-90% and close with a cap</li>
    <li>Place the bottle in the freezer so that about 1/5 of it becomes ice (about 2-3 hours)</li>
    <li>Keep the liquid water, throw away the frozen water</li></ul>
    <p><b>2. Form the ice</b></p>
    <ul><li>The remaining water begins to form the ice core. As the ice crystals start to form, they naturally push away all impurities and admixtures.</li></ul>
    <p><b>3. Remove the unfrozen water</b></p>
    <ul><li>The water that does not freeze because of impurities stays in a liquid form.</li></ul>
    <p><b>4. Melt the ice</b></p>
    <ul><li>The final layer of absolutely pure and crystal clean ice is melted back into water and bottled for your enjoyment.</li></ul>
    <p><b>5. Make crystal water</b></p>
    <ul><li>Put the deuterium-depleted water in a bottle and freeze it for at least 6 hours</li>
    <li>The water after defrosting is crystal water</li></ul>
    <p><b>Information</b></p>
    <ul><li>Deuterium (heavy water) is harmful and toxic</li>
	<li>The melting point of deuterium is +3.8°C</li>
	<li>Impurities freeze at -7°C</li>
    <li>Do not use snow, because it contains a lot of dirt, heavy metals and harmful salts</li>
	<li>Do not use chlorinated tap water, which is dangerous and can lead to cancer</li>
	<li>Melt water should be used immediately in small sips (before 8 hours) after defrosting (about +10°C)</li>
	<li>Melt water preserves its good properties for 7 days, and loses it when heated above +40°C (better immediately at +20-25°C)</li>
	<li>Melt water should not be boiled, because all beneficial properties are lost</li>
	<li>No more than 30% of the total liquid volume can be meltwater (3-5 glasses)</li>
	<li>If you are 55 kg, you need 550 ml of melt water per day</li>
	<li>Drink in the morning on an empty stomach or one hour before meals</li>
	<li>Do not add lemons, berries, sugar</li>
	<li>After 30-40 days take a break, but sometimes 1-2 glasses are OK)</li>
	</ul>
