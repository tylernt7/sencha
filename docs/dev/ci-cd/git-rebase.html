    <h1>Git Rebase</h1>
	
	<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<div class="code"><code><pre>git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"</pre></code></div>
Set Notepad++ as the Git editor instead of Vim. See <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/How-to-set-Notepad-as-the-default-Git-editor-for-commits-instead-of-Vim">here</a>

	<h2>Update the Main Branch</h2>
<div class="code"><code><pre>git switch main
git pull
git switch feature
</pre></code></div>
Update the main branch with the latest changes, and then switch back to the feature branch.

	<h2>Squash Commits on a Feature Branch (optional)</h2>
<div class="code"><code><pre>git log --graph --oneline --all</pre></code></div>
This command displays the commit history (in a graph format) in reverse chronological order (most recent at the top) for all branches.<br>
Determine the number of commits you want to squash on the feature branch, for example, 5.<br>
<br>
<div class="code"><code><pre>git rebase -i HEAD~5</pre></code></div>
This command starts an interactive rebase session:
<ul>
<li>It opens a text editor (Notepad++) with a list of the last 5 commits, in chronological order (oldest at the top)</li>
<li>The word "pick" indicates that the commit will be included in the rebase</li>
<li>Lines starting with "#" are comments</li>
<li>Changing "pick" to "s" or "squash" combines the commit with the previous commits.</li>
</ul>
Keep "pick" for the <i>first commit</i> and change the subsequent lines from "pick" to "s". After saving and closing the file, Git will reopen the text editor to let you edit the commit message for the squashed commit. Include only the necessary commit messages and remove the rest. Once you save and close this file, the rebase will be completed.<br>
<br>
<div class="code"><code><pre>git status</pre></code></div>
This command shows that the local branch has diverged from the remote 'origin' because the commit history has been rewritten by the rebase command. The local branch contains the squashed commit, while 'origin' contains the initial commits.<br>
Because of this divergence, a standard 'git push' does not work and causes an error.<br>
Do not try to 'git pull', as it tries to merge the local branch using the old commit history.<br>
<br>
<div class="code"><code><pre>git push -f</pre></code></div>
This command forcefully pushes the local branch changes to the remote repository, overwriting the commit history on 'origin'.<br>
Force pushing is discouraged on shared branches because it modifies the commit history, which can cause issues if others are collaborating on the same branch. However, force pushing is acceptable on a feature branch.<br>
<br>
This part is <i>optional</i>, it is only needed if there are many commits in the feature branch. Rebasing the feature branch onto the main branch when it contains a single commit, you will need to resolve <b>conflicts only once</b> (the same file will not come up as a conflict more than once).

	<h2>Rebase onto the main branch</h2>
<div class="code"><code><pre>git switch feature       # Switch to the feature branch
git rebase main          # Start the rebase onto the main branch
# resolve any conflicts that arise
git add .                # Stage the resolved files
git rebase --continue    # Continue the rebase process
git push -f              # Force push the changes to the remote feature branch
</pre></code></div>
	<h2>Best Practices</h2>
To keep the feature branch updated with the main branch (to avoid diverging too much from the main branch), rebase the feature branch onto the main branch (instead of merging) after pulling changes from the main branch. This is because the incoming commits from the main branch would mix them with your commits, interrupting the linear history.

    <h2>GitLab Merge Requests</h2>
	<b><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/methods/">Merge method</a> settings</b><br>
	Determine what happens to the commit history when you merge a merge request.<br>
	<b>- Merge commit</b><br>
	Every merge creates a merge commit.<br>
	<b>- Merge commit with semi-linear history</b><br>
	Every merge creates a merge commit.<br>
	Merging is only allowed when the source branch is up-to-date with its target.<br>
	When semi-linear merge is not possible, the user is given the option to rebase.<br>
	<b>- Fast-forward merge</b> (*)<br>
	No merge commits are created.<br>
	Fast-forward merges only.<br>
	When there is a merge conflict, the user is given the option to rebase.<br>
	If merge trains are enabled, merging is only possible if the branch can be rebased withoutÂ conflicts.
