    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>	
	
	<h2>Concepts of OOP</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Class</b>: A class is a blueprint or prototype from which (individual) objects are created. It models the state and behavior of a real-world object.</li>
	  <li><b>Object</b>: An object is an instance of a class. Real-world objects have state and behavior: dogs have state (name, color) and behavior (barking, fetching). A software object stores its state in fields (variables) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions). </li>
	  	  
	  <li><b>Interface</b>: An interface defines the behavior (signatures/declarations/prototypes/syntaxes of methods) that a class must implement. It also sets the communication boundary between two pieces of software. It defines the interaction with the outside world (external systems).
	  <ul><li>Different groups of programmers agree to a <i>"contract"</i> (interface) that describes how their software interacts. Each group should be able to write their code without any knowledge of how the other group's code is written.</li></ul>
	  <ul><li>An interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiated - they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.</li></ul>
	  <ul><li><a href="https://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/designprinciples.html">Program to an Interface (P2I)</a> principle states that concrete objects must implement an interface that is used in the caller program rather than the concrete object itself. Therefore, you can easily substitute a different implementation with little impact on client code in the future. It's best practice to use an interface for the code that is most likely to change implementation. You could change the ArrayList implementation to a LinkedList. You might have difficulties with the <i>Programming to an Implementation</i> if a list implementation might change in the future, or if you need different list at runtime.
	  <ul><li>List list = new ArrayList(); <i>// Program to an Interface</i></li></ul>
	  <ul><li>ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList(); <i>// Program to an Implementation</i></li></ul>
	  </li></ul>		  
	  <ul><li><i>Marker Interface</i>: An interface that does not have any methods or constants. E.g. <i>Cloneable, Serializable</i> or <i>Remote</i> interfaces indicate whether an object can be cloned, serialized or available remotely. On Android the main purpose of <i>@NonNull</i> is informational to the other developers that they shall not pass null value.</li></ul>
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Package</b>: A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. It defines scope to a set of related objects in an application.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Basic Principles of OOP</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Data Abstraction / Information Hiding</b> <i>(Adatabsztrakció / Információ elrejtése)</i>: Hiding the characteristics and behavior from other objects using visibility levels (private, protected), so as to prevent misuse. </li>
	  
	  <li><b>Encapsulation</b> <i>(Egységbezárás)</i>: Enclosing attributes and operations (fields and methods) into a single unit/entity (object). Encapsulation in Java is implemented by making instance variables private and providing indirect access using methods (sometimes simply getters and setters) to read and manipulate them. Encapsulation describes the ability of an object to hide its data and methods from the rest of the world. A major goal of encapsulation is to allow objects to protect themselves against arbitrary manipulation of their state. Invalid state can be month -3 or day of month 42.</li>	  	
	  <li><b>Inheritance</b> <i>(Öröklés)</i>: A more specific class (subclass, derived class, child class) can be created from a general class (superclass, base class, parent class). A subclass inherits fields, methods, and nested classes from its superclass. Constructors are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass. 
	  <ul><li>Every class is implicitly a subclass of Object</li></ul>
	  <ul><li>C# and Java support single inheritance only: every class has only one direct superclass</li></ul>
	  <ul><li>Do not develop a hierarchy of three or more classes: <i>favor composition over inheritance</i></li></ul></li>	 
	  <center><p><img src="images\composition.png" width="40%" height="40%"/></p></center>
	  
	  <li><b>Polymorphism</b> <i>(Többalakúság, sokoldalúság)</i>: An object can have many different forms: one name, many forms / one interface, multiple methods. Multiple classes can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same methods in different ways, e.g. each Shape (Circle or Square) has a draw() method to draw the particular shape.</li>
	  <ul><li>Ad hoc polymorphism
	    <ul><li>Function overloading
	      <ul><li>Overriding: Same method name, same parameter (inheritance)</li></ul>
	      <ul><li>Overloading: Same method name, different parameter type/number/order (same class)</li></ul></li></ul>
	    <ul><li>Operator overloading: A user-defined type can overload a predefined operator (<i>operator</i> in C++/C#)</li></ul></li></ul>				
	  <ul><li>Parametric polymorphism
	    <ul><li>Generic programming: C++ templates and C#/Java generics</li></ul></li></ul>
	  <ul><li>Subtyping: Methods that operate on supertypes can also operate on subtypes (Liskov Substitution Principle), e.g. circles and squares subtypes of shapes (inheritance)
	    <ul><li>Virtual function/method: An (overridable) method whose implementation is determined at runtime based on the actual (dynamic) type/class of the object
		  <ul><li><i>Shape circle = new Circle(); circle.draw();</i> - The draw() method of the Circle object is called (and not of the Shape class)</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>In Java methods are virtual</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>In C++/C# methods must have <i>virtual</i> keyword if they are not <i>abstract</i> (in the base class)</li></ul>		  
		</li></ul>		
	    <ul><li>Single dispatch:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;The implementation of a method depends on the actual type of the object at runtime (C#/Java)</li></ul>
		<ul><li>Double dispatch:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of a method depends on the actual types of two arguments at runtime (<i>dynamic</i> in C#)</li></ul>
		<ul><li>Multiple dispatch:&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of a method depends on the actual types of all the arguments at runtime (<i>dynamic</i> in C#, MultiJava)</li></ul>
	    <ul><li>Predicate dispatch: Each implementation of a method includes a guard specifying the conditions under
which the method should be called (JPred)</li></ul>
	    <ul><li><i>Note</i>: Java only supports single dispatch (i.e. single-argument polymorphism): only the first argument (the <i>this</i> object) is used. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Java">Multiple dispatch</a> can be emulated with multiple levels of single dispatch</li></ul>
        </li></ul>

	</ul>		
	<h2>Other Principles</h2>
	<ul>	
	  <li><b>IoC (Inversion of Control)</b> <i>(Kontroll megfordítása)</i>: Transferring the control of objects to a framework</li>
	  <ul><li>Service Locator Pattern</li></ul>	  
	  <ul><li>Dependency Injection</li></ul>
	  <ul><li>Contextualized Lookup</li></ul>
	  <ul><li>Template Method Design Pattern</li></ul>
	  <ul><li>Strategy Design Pattern</li></ul>		  
	  <li><b>Law of Demeter</b> <i>(Demeter törvénye)</i>: Only talk to your immediate friends (don't talk to strangers)</li>
	  <ul><li>A --> B --> C (avoid transitive dependencies)</li></ul>	
	  <ul><li>More maintainable and adaptable since objects are less dependent on the internal structure of other objects, object implementation can be changed without reworking their callers</li></ul>		  
	  <li><b>YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)</b>: ...</li>
	  <li><b>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</b>: ...</li>
	  <li><b>GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Pattern)</b>: ...</li>
	  <li><b>KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)</b>: ...</li>
	  <br>
	  <li><b>POJO (Plain Old Java Object)</b>: Ordinary Java object, e.g. <a href="https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/7224-javabeans-1.01-fr-spec-oth-JSpec/beans.101.pdf">JavaBean</a> (serializable, no-argument constructor, getter and setter methods)</li>
	  <li><b>POCO (Plain Old CLR Object)</b>: Simple class with no (framework) dependencies</li>
