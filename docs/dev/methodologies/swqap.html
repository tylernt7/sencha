    <h2>4 Software Development Processes</h2>	
    <h3>4.1 Version Control System</h3>
	<p>Git as a version control system is a software tool that helps to track and manage changes to the software code, documents, and other artifacts in a software project. It helps to ensure the quality, consistency, and reliability of the software products or services, by enabling different types of testing, reviewing, and deploying on different versions or branches of the software code. It also helps to communicate the changes, updates, and statuses of the software code to the software project team, the software provider, and the software customers or users.</p>
	<center><img src="images/gitflow.png" width="75%" height="75%"/></center>
	Gitflow defines the following types of branches:
	<ul>	
	<li>1 A Development Branch is forked from Master Branch</li>
	<li>2 A Release Branch is forked from Development Branch</li>
	<li>3 Feature branches are forked from Development Branch</li>
	<li>4 When a feature is complete, it is merged into the Development Branch</li>
	<li>5 When the Release Branch is done, it is merged into Master Branch (and Development Branch)</li>
	<li>6 If an issue in Master Branch is detected, a Hotfix Branch is forked from Master Branch</li>
	<li>7 Once the hotfix is complete, it is merged to both Master Branch and Development Branch</li>
	<li>8 Master Branch should be tagged with a version number</li>
	</ul>
	The Master Branch stores the releases, and the Development Branch serves as an integration branch for features. Each new feature should reside in its own branch. Features, bug fixes and documentations go in Release Branch. Hotfix Branches are used to quickly patch releases.
	
    <h3>4.2 Branching Strategy</h3>
	<p>A branching strategy is a set of rules and guidelines that define how branches are created, named, managed, merged, deleted, and documented in a software project. A branching strategy helps to organize and coordinate the work of multiple developers or teams on a shared codebase, using a version control system. It also helps to ensure the quality, stability, and security of the software product or service, by enabling different types of testing, reviewing, and deploying on different branches.</p>
	<p>Elements of the branching strategy are:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Branching model is Git/GitLab Flow.</li>
	<li>Branch naming conventions are features/feature-name for feature branching, bugfixes/description for bug and hot fixes, users/username/description for developer specific branches.</li>
	<li>Branch merging rule is merge requests/pull requests with code reviews and approvals.</li>
	<li>Branch lifecycle management practices are creating branches from the master branch, updating branches regularly with the latest changes from the master branch, deleting branches after merging them to the master branch, keeping branches short-lived and focused on a single feature or bug fix.</li>
	</ul>    
	
	<h3>4.3 Version Tagging</h3>
	<p>Version Tagging is a process of labeling or marking a specific version of the software code, documents, and other artifacts in a software project as stable, reliable, and ready for production. It helps to identify and access the stable versions easily and quickly, without having to remember the exact revision number or date. It also helps to communicate the release status and history of the software products or services to the software project team, the software provider, and the software customers or users.</p>
	<p>Semantic Versioning:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>A version number is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</li>
	<li>The MAJOR part is incremented when there are incompatible or breaking changes in the software code, such as changing the interface or removing a feature</li>
	<li>The MINOR part is incremented when there are new features or enhancements in the software code that are backward compatible, such as adding a new function or improving performance</li>
	<li>The PATCH part is incremented when there are bug fixes or corrections in the software code that are backward compatible, such as fixing an error or resolving an issue</li>	
	<li>Examples: v1.2.1, v2.0.0-beta.1, v2.0.0-rc.1</li>	
	</ul> 	
	<p>If the project is still in the initial development phase, meaning that it has a rapidly changing and unstable code, then the first tag version number should be 0.1.0. This indicates that any subsequent changes may not be backward compatible. The MAJOR part should remain at 0 until the project reaches a stable state and becomes 1.0.0.</p>
	
	<h3>4.4 Code Review Process</h3>
	<p>Code Review Process is a process of systematically examining and evaluating the software code, documents, and other artifacts in a software project by one or more peers before they are merged and shipped. It helps to ensure or improve the quality, consistency, and reliability of the software products or services, by identifying and fixing bugs, errors, vulnerabilities, or other issues. It also helps to share knowledge, skills, and best practices among the software project team members and stakeholders.</p>
