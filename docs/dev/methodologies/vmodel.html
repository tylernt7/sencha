    <h2>Terminology</h2>
	<b>Verification</b> <i>Are you doing what is written?</i>
	<ul>
	<li>Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that specified requirements have been fulfilled [ISO 9000]</li>
	<li>Evaluating a work product, component or system to determine whether it meets the requirements set</li>
	<li>Checking the fulfillment of a requirement by an implemented system </li>
	<li>Are we building the product <b><u>right</u></b>?</li>
	<li>Is the system correct to specification?</li>
	<li>Is the deliverable built according to the specification?</li>
	<li>Same as <i>testing</i></li>
	</ul>	
	<b>Validation</b> <i>Is the description good?</i>
	<ul>
	<li>Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled [ISO 9000]</li>	
	<li>Evaluating a work product, component or system to determine whether it meets the user/customer needs and requirements</li>
	<li>Checking whether documented requirements match the stakeholdersâ€™ needs. Discover errors in the requirements: ambiguity, incompleteness, contradictions and incomprehensibility</li>	
    <li>Are we building the <b><u>right</u></b> product?</li>
	<li>Is this the right specification?</li>
	<li>Is the deliverable fit for purpose, e.g. does it provide a solution to the problem?</li>	
	</ul>
	<b>Traceability</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Test conditions should be able to be linked back to their sources in the test basis (e.g. requirements)</li>	
	<li>The ability to trace a requirement (1) back to its origins (stakeholders, documents, rationale, etc.), (2) forward to its implementation in design and code, (3) to requirements it depends on (and vice-versa)</li>	
	<li><i>Vertical traceability</i> shows relationships between requirements and <i>horizontal traceability</i> displays relationships between requirements and test cases</li>	
	</ul>
