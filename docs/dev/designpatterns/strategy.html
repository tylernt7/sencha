    <h1>Strategy</h1>
	
    <h2>Intent</h2>	
    <ul>
      <li>Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.</li>  
      <li>Examples: 
      <ul><li>Any of modes of transportation will get a traveler to the airport, and they can be used interchangeably. The traveler must choose the Strategy based on trade-offs between cost, convenience, and time.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>There are different ways to pay (PayPal, Credit Card, etc.) when you want to buy a product in an e-commerce. Purchase is our goal/context which provides all the possible strategies that the client can use to pay.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The client can switch between different sorting strategies including Quicksort, Shellsort, and Mergesort.</li></ul>
      </li>	  
    </ul>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>The "context" is the code (does not need to be a class) where "strategic method(s)" are called and the strategic logic is kept.</p>
