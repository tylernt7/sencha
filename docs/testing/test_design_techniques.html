    <h1>Test design techniques</h1> 
    <h2>Black-box (specification-based) techniques</h2>
	<ul><li><b>Equivalence partitioning</b> (partition testing): Test cases are designed to execute representatives from equivalence partitions and to cover each partition at least once.
	<ul><li><b>Equivalence partition</b> (equivalence class): A portion of an input or output domain for which the behavior of a component or system is assumed to be the same, based on the specification.</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>Boundary value analysis</b>: Test cases are designed based on boundary values.
	<ul><li><b>Boundary value:</b> The minimum or maximum value of a range (ordered equivalence partition). An input value or output value which is on the edge of an equivalence partition or at the smallest incremental distance on either side of an edge.</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>Decision table testing</b>: Test cases are designed to execute the combinations of conditions and the resulting actions shown in a decision table.
	<ul><li><b>Decision table:</b> A table showing combinations of inputs and/or stimuli (causes) with their associated outputs and/or actions (effects), which can be used to design test cases.</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>State transition testing</b> (finite state testing, N-switch testing): Test cases are designed to execute valid and invalid state transitions.
	<ul><li><b>State diagram</b>: A diagram that depicts the states that a component or system can assume, and shows the events or circumstances that cause and/or result from a change from one state to another. [IEEE 610]</li></ul>
	<ul><li><b>State transition</b>: A transition between two states of a component or system.</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>Use case testing</b> (user scenario testing): Test cases are designed to execute scenarios of use cases (use case behaviors).
	<ul><li><b>Use case</b>: A sequence of transactions in a dialogue between an actor and a component or system with a tangible result, where an actor can be a user or anything that can exchange information with the system.</li></ul></li></ul>
