    <h1>Test design techniques</h1> 
    <h2>Black-box (specification-based) techniques</h2>
	<ul><li><b>Equivalence partitioning</b> (partition testing): Test cases are designed to execute representatives from equivalence partitions and to cover each partition at least once.
	<ul><li><b>Equivalence partition</b> (equivalence class): A portion of an input or output domain for which the behavior of a component or system is assumed to be the same, based on the specification.</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>Boundary value analysis</b>: Test cases are designed based on boundary values.
	<ul><li><b>Boundary value:</b> The minimum or maximum value of a range (ordered equivalence partition). An input value or output value which is on the edge of an equivalence partition or at the smallest incremental distance on either side of an edge.</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>Decision table testing</b>: Test cases are designed to execute the combinations of conditions and the resulting actions shown in a decision table.
	<ul><li><b>Decision table:</b> A table showing combinations of inputs and/or stimuli (causes) with their associated outputs and/or actions (effects), which can be used to design test cases.</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>State transition testing</b> (finite state testing, N-switch testing): Test cases are designed to execute valid and invalid state transitions.
	<ul><li><b>State diagram</b>: A diagram that depicts the states that a component or system can assume, and shows the events or circumstances that cause and/or result from a change from one state to another. [IEEE 610]</li></ul>
	<ul><li><b>State transition</b>: A transition between two states of a component or system.</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>Use case testing</b> (user scenario testing): Test cases are designed to execute scenarios of use cases (use case behaviors).
	<ul><li><b>Use case</b>: A sequence of transactions in a dialogue between an actor and a component or system with a tangible result, where an actor can be a user or anything that can exchange information with the system.</li></ul></li></ul>

    <h2>White-box (structure-based) techniques</h2>	
    <ul><li><b>Statement coverage</b>: The percentage of executable statements that have been exercised by a test suite.
	<ul><li><b>Statement</b>: An entity in a programming language, which is typically the smallest indivisible unit of execution.</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>Decision coverage</b>: The percentage of decision outcomes that have been exercised by a test suite. 100% decision coverage implies both 100% branch coverage and 100% statement coverage.	
    <ul><li><b>Decision</b>: A program point at which the control flow has two or more alternative routes. A node with two or more links to separate branches.</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>Branch coverage</b>: The percentage of branches in a control flow graph that have been exercised by a test suite. 100% branch coverage implies both 100% decision coverage and 100% statement coverage.		
	<ul><li><b>Branch</b>: A basic block that can be selected for execution based on a program construct in which one of two or more alternative program paths is available, e.g. case, jump, go to, if-then-else.</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>Linear Code Sequence And Jump (LCSAJ) coverage</b>: The percentage of LCSAJs of a component that have been exercised by a test suite. 100% LCSAJ coverage implies 100% decision coverage.
	<ul><li><b>LCSAJ</b>: A Linear Code Sequence And Jump, consists of the following three items (conventionally identified by line numbers in a source code listing): the start of the linear sequence of executable statements, the end of the linear sequence, and the target line to which control flow is transferred at the end of the linear sequence.</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>Condition coverage</b>: The percentage of condition outcomes that have been exercised by a test suite. 100% condition coverage requires each single condition in every decision statement to be tested as True and False.
	<ul><li><b>Condition</b>: A logical expression that can be evaluated as True or False, e.g. A>B.</li></ul></li>				
	<li><b>Multiple condition coverage</b> (condition combination coverage): The percentage of combinations of all single condition outcomes within one (decision) statement that have been exercised by a test suite. 100% multiple condition coverage implies 100% condition determination coverage.	
	<ul><li><b>Multiple condition (compound condition)</b>: Two or more single conditions joined by means of a logical operator (AND, OR or XOR), e.g. 'A>B AND C>1000'.</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>Condition determination coverage</b> (multiple condition decision coverage, modified multiple condition coverage, modified condition/decision coverage, MC/DC): The percentage of all single/atomic condition outcomes that independently affect the overall decision outcome that have been exercised by a test case suite. 100% condition determination coverage implies 100% decision condition coverage.</li>
	<li><b>Path coverage</b>: The percentage of paths that have been exercised by a test suite. 100% path coverage implies 100% LCSAJ coverage.
    <ul><li><b>Path</b>: A sequence of events, e.g. executable statements, of a component or system from an entry point to an exit point. A sequence of consecutive edges in a directed graph (control flow graph).</li></ul></li></ul>
