    <h2>Test Estimation Techniques</h2>	
	<b>Test estimation</b>: The calculated approximation of a result related to various aspects of testing (e.g. effort spent, completion date, costs involved, number of test cases, etc.) which is usable even if input d may be incomplete, uncertain, or noisy.<br>	
	<b>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</b>: An arrangement of work elements and their relationship to each other and to the end product.<br>
    <b>Three-Point Estimation</b>: A test estimation method using estimated values for the "best case", "worst case", and "most likely case" of the matter being estimated, to define the degree of certainty associated with the resultant estimate. The expected testing time is calculated by using a weighted average of the three estimates, such as (O + 4M + P) / 6.<br>
    <b>Function Point Analysis (FPA)</b>: Method aiming to measure the size of the functionality of an information system. The measurement is independent of the technology. This measurement may be used as a basis for the measurement of productivity, the estimation of the needed resources, and project control.<br>	
	<b>Test Point Analysis (TPA)</b>: A formula based test estimation method based on function point analysis.<br>	
    <b>Use Case Points</b> (Use Case Point Analysis, UCPA): A top-down estimation technique used to forecast (measure) the size and complexity of a software project from its use cases. The UCP can be used to estimate the effort, cost, and duration of the project too.<br>	
    <b>Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)</b>: A statistical tool used in project management to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a project. It helps to plan and schedule complex projects.<br>
	<b>Wideband Delphi</b>: An expert-based test estimation technique that aims at making an accurate estimation using the collective wisdom of the team members.<br>	
	<b>Ad-hoc testing</b>: Testing carried out informally; no formal test preparation takes place, no recognized test design technique is used, there are no expectations for results and arbitrariness guides the test execution activity.<br>
	<b>Planning poker</b>: A consensus-based estimation technique, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of user stories in agile software development. It is a variation of the Wide Band Delphi method using a deck of cards with values representing the units in which the team estimates.<br>
    <b>Expert Judgment</b>: A technique to estimate the cost and duration of a project based on the expert's opinion<br>
