    <h2>Tool support for performance</h2>	

	<ul><li><b>Performance testing</b>: The process of testing to determine the performance of a software product.
	<ul><li><b>Performance</b>: The degree to which a system or component accomplishes its designated functions within given constraints regarding processing time and throughput rate. [After IEEE 610]</li>
	<li><b>Efficiency</b>: The capability of the software product to provide appropriate performance, relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions. [ISO 9126]</li></ul>
	<li><b>Load testing</b>: A type of performance testing conducted to evaluate the behavior of a component or system with increasing load, e.g. numbers of parallel users and/or numbers of transactions, to determine what load can be handled by the component or system.
	<ul><li><b>Step-up testing</b>: Multi-level load testing (incremental/progressive/gradual/staged testing)</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>Stress testing</b>: A type of performance testing conducted to evaluate a system or component at or beyond the limits of its anticipated or specified work loads, or with reduced availability of resources such as access to memory or servers. [After IEEE 610]	
	<ul><li><b>Spike testing</b>: Testing to determine the ability of a system to recover from sudden bursts of peak loads and return to a steady state.</li>
	<li><b>Break-point testing</b>: Fatigue test (threshold/limit/boundary testing)</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>Volume testing</b>: Testing where the system is subjected to large volumes of data.</li>	
	<li><b>Resource utilization testing</b>: The process of testing to determine the resource-utilization of a software product.
	<ul><li><b>Resource utilization</b>: The capability of the software product to use appropriate amounts and types of resources, for example the amounts of main and secondary memory used by the program and the sizes of required temporary or overflow files, when the software performs its function under stated conditions. [After ISO 9126]</li></ul></li>	
	<li><b>Endurance testing</b> (Soak testing): Testing to determine the stability of a system under a significant load over a significant period of time within the system's operational context.</li>
