    <h1>TCS (Tata Consultancy Services)</h1>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Tell me about your experience, especially the technologies you used or learned.</li>
	  <li>Was your project a monolith or a microservices application?</li>
	  <li>Which versions of Java and Spring did you use on your previous project? (Java 21 (LTS), Spring Boot 3.5.4)</li>
	  <li>Can you tell me about the groups into which all design patterns (GoF patterns) are divided?</li>
	  <li>Can you explain the proxy pattern from the structural group, how it works, and where it is used?</li>
	  <li>Compare the proxy and decorator patterns. How are they different?</li>
	  <li>When using a decorator or a proxy, do we operate with the real object or not? What is the difference?</li>
	  <li>You mentioned there are two ways to create a proxy. Can you name them and explain how they are different?</li>
	  <li>Explain how HashMap works under the hood, including the algorithm for adding a key-value pair.</li>
	  - buckets, linked list or tree, hashCode	  
	  <li>What are the contracts of equals and hashCode methods? What is the contract between them?</li>
	  - If two objects are equal (equals()), they must have the same hashCode().
	  <li>Can you name any collections that allow us to work in a multithreaded environment, like concurrent collections?</li>
	  <li>Why is ConcurrentHashMap fast in a multithreaded environment?</li>
	  - segment or bucket-level locks, not a single global lock.
	  <li>Can you give a definition of a functional interface in Java?</li>
	  - interface that contains exactly one abstract method.<br>
	  - Runnable, Comparator, and Consumer. You can annotate it with @FunctionalInterface
	  <li>What about other methods in a functional interface?</li>
	  <li>What is the core difference between the @Bean and @Component annotations in Spring?</li>
	  @Bean: Used on methods in @Configuration classes to manually create and configure a Spring bean.<br>
	  @Component: Used on classes to mark them for automatic detection and registration as beans via classpath scanning.<br>
	  @Bean is method-level and explicit; @Component is class-level and implicit via scanning.<br>
	  <li>What is MVC?</li>
	  <li>What options do we have to handle incoming requests in a Spring controller? Which annotations would you use to write a controller class?</li>
	  <li>What is the difference between @RestController and @Controller annotations in Spring?</li>
	  <li>How can we implement exception handling in a Spring MVC application?</li>
	  <li>Do you have any experience with Spring Boot Actuator or do you know about it?</li>
	  <li>Do you have experience with conditional annotations in Spring Boot, or could you explain for what purposes we can use them?</li>
	  <li>Could you name the requirements for a class to be an entity in Hibernate?</li>
	  <li>And some questions about db n+1 problem	</li>
	</ul>
